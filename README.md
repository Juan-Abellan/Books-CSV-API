# Books-CSV-API

## Background & Objectives

The goal of this reboot is to load the data from the CSV + loop over rows to enrich each row with information such as:
- List of subjects (Science, Humor, Travel, etc.)
- The cover URL of the book
- Other information you’d find useful in the JSON API

## Data

In this reboot, we are going to use:
- The Goodreads books dataset from Kaggle (a CSV to download)
- The Open Library Books API

## Tools

For this exercise we will work with a Python Jupyter Notebook using libraries as numpy, pandas, requests and tqdm.
